# CIP Core (Generic Profile) Demonstration and Test Images

This generates bootable images for virtual and physical targets using the
Debian package set of the [CIP](https://www.cip-project.org/) Core Generic
Profile and the CIP SLTS kernel.

The build system used for this is [Isar](https://github.com/ilbers/isar), an
image generator that assembles Debian binaries or builds individual packages
from scratch.

## Building Target Images

Install docker or podman and make sure you have required permissions to start
privileged containers. For docker, you need to be part of respective docker
group (`sudo usermod -aG docker <USER>`). Privileged podman requires sudo
rights for the caller (`<USER> ALL=(root) SETENV: /usr/bin/podman` in sudoers).

Open up the image configuration menu and select the desired target and its
options:

    ./kas-container menu

You can directly start the build from the menu.

If you prefer selecting the configuration via the command line, this builds
the BeagleBone Black target image with real-time kernel, e.g.:

    ./kas-container build kas-cip.yml:kas/board/bbb.yml:kas/opt/rt.yml


## Running Target Images

When having built a virtual QEMU target image, this can be started directly.
Run, e.g.,

    ./start-qemu.sh x86

when having built a QEMU AMD64 image. Using the image configuration menu will
initialize variables used by start-qemu.sh with fitting defaults. Otherwise, a
security image for QEMU can be started like this:

    TARGET_IMAGE=cip-core-image-security ./start-qemu.sh x86

Physical targets will generate ready-to-boot images under
`build/tmp/deploy/images/`. To flash, e.g., the BeagleBone Black image to an SD
card, run

    dd if=build/tmp/deploy/images/bbb/cip-core-image-cip-core-buster-bbb.wic \
       of=/dev/<medium-device> bs=1M status=progress

or via bmap-tools

    bmaptool copy build/tmp/deploy/images/bbb/cip-core-image-cip-core-buster-bbb.wic /dev/<medium-device>
